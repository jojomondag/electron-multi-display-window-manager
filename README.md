# Electron Window Manager

A desktop application for advanced window management with state persistence and Windows Snap Layout integration.

## Overview

The Electron Window Manager provides a centralized interface for creating, managing, and organizing multiple windows while maintaining their exact state across application restarts. Features full compatibility with Windows native snap layouts and third-party window management tools.

## Features

- Multi-window management from single interface
- Persistent window positions, sizes, and properties
- Windows Snap Layout integration
- Third-party snap tool support (StickySnap, PowerToys)
- Multi-display positioning
- Z-order and focus management
- Real-time window monitoring

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+
- Windows 10/11 (recommended)

### Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd electron-window-configurator
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Create windows with custom titles
3. Use Windows Snap Layouts or third-party tools normally
4. Window positions and sizes are automatically saved
5. Windows restore to exact positions on restart

## Architecture

### Core Files
- `main.js` - Application controller and IPC communication
- `window-manager.js` - Window management engine with snap detection
- `preload.js` - Secure IPC bridge
- `index.html` - Management interface
- `window.html` - Managed window template

### Key Features
- Dual storage system (window-state + window-registry)
- Advanced snap detection for Windows and third-party tools
- Multi-display intelligence with display-relative positioning
- Unified event handling and debounced saving

## Configuration

The application uses `electron-store` for persistent storage:
- Window states: positions, sizes, display information
- Window registry: metadata and relationships
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned states

## Troubleshooting

**Window positioning issues**: Check display configuration and snap tool compatibility
**Multi-monitor problems**: Verify display IDs in console output
**Snap state conflicts**: Ensure Windows Snap Layouts are enabled

Debug information available through built-in console logging.

### Dependencies
- Electron ^29.4.6
